## 🧩 Maze Solving Using DFS

**Maze Voyager** is a visual and interactive application designed to demonstrate how the **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithm can be used to solve mazes. It provides an engaging way to understand pathfinding, graph traversal, and backtracking through a rich visual interface.

### 🔍 Key Concepts

- Depth-First Search (DFS)  
- Graph Traversal  
- Backtracking  
- Maze Representation  
- Pathfinding Algorithms  

### ⚙️ Algorithm Execution

- Step-by-step DFS traversal with animations  
- Real-time stack visualization  
- Highlights decision points with multiple path choices  

### 📈 Solution Analysis

- Displays the final path from start to goal  
- Key statistics shown:
  - Path length  
  - Total cells visited  
  - Number of backtracks
